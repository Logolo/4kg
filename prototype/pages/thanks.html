				Thank you for buying a &ldquo;Donate Key&rdquo; for my HTML5 game, 4kg. There is now a record stored
				on your computer that you donated, and this may be used in the future to unlock bonuses in 4kg or other
				games I make. Thank you so much for validating my hard work and funding further development. If you're
				so inclined, you can buy a Donate Key as many times as you wish. It's a pain if you want to give more
				than <span class="abbr" title="USD">$2</span>, but it's a limit of the Google In-App Payment API right
				now. Still, thanks! I'm very glad you enjoyed 4kg.
