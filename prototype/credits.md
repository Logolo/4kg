# Credits

4kg was my idea and I spent many, many sleepless nights designing it, coding it, making art assets for it, choosing
music for it, and more, but I owe special thanks to a couple people, without whome 4kg would not have been possible.

## Engine and some code

The entire engine and much of 4kg's actual code come from [Akihabara](kesiev.com/akihabara/) and the
[Leave Me Alone](http://www.kesiev.com/akihabara/demo/game-leavemealone.html) platformer demo, respectively.

## Music
Coming soon.
